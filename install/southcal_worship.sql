Our worship services are designed to aid people in focusing on, and experiencing God in their lives. As such, it is important that attention be given to minimizing distractions during our worship times.</p>\r\n<p>Inappropriate attire worn by service platform participants can pose as a serious distraction during worship. While we have a fairly casual attitude toward worship attire within our congregation, it is important that, in the words of the Apostle Paul, we don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;the exercise of our freedom, become a stumbling block&rdquo; to others <em>(1 Cor. 8:9)</em>. The Bible also states that &ldquo;nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others&rdquo; <em>(1 Cor. 10:24)</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Personal attire standards vary to some degree from individual to individual, and congregation to congregation. As such, we deem it important to articulate the attire standards deemed appropriate for platform service participants here at SCCC. Our desire in publishing these attire guidelines is not to be unduly restrictive or burdensome, but rather, to help ensure undistracted worship within our spiritual family.</p>\r\n<p>The following attire policy applies to all regularly-scheduled sanctuary platform participants <em>(i.e. choir members, worship singers, worship band members, etc.) </em>here at South Calgary <em>(except as noted below)</em> during worship services and Worship Ministry rehearsals:</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Men and Women&rsquo;s Attire</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tight-fitting or Revealing Attire:&nbsp; </strong>Any attire <em>(tops, shirts, pants, shorts, dresses, etc.)</em> which is tight-fitting or revealing at the chest/bust, hips, buttocks, groin or thighs is inappropriate on the platform and should be avoided.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tattered Clothing:&nbsp; </strong>Tattered or torn attire <em>(i.e. jeans with holes or unhemed cut-offs)</em> are not appropriate on the platform and should be avoided.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Footwear:&nbsp; </strong>All platform participants should wear shoes. Sandals are permitted. Flip-flops are not permitted. <em>(Please note footwear restrictions apply to worship services only and are NOT in effect at rehearsals.)</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Headwear:&nbsp; </strong>Dress headwear for women is permitted. Casual<strong> </strong>outdoor headwear <em>(i.e. ball caps, toques, etc)</em> is not permitted for men or women on the platform. <em>(Please note that headwear restrictions apply to worship services only and are NOT in effect at rehearsals.)</em><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Men&rsquo;s Attire</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Shirts:&nbsp; </strong>Men&rsquo;s shirts should have sleeves <em>(i.e. no muscle shirts)</em>.

Shirts should be long enough that no flesh is exposed at the midriff, hips or buttocks while standing with arms fully extended over the head, sitting, or bending fully forward at the waist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pants: </strong>Jeans are acceptable provided they are not tight-fitting and do not have holes. Waist line should be high enough that no flesh is exposed at the midriff, hips or buttocks when standing with arms fully extended above the head, sitting or bending fully forward at the waist. Low-rider jeans or pants are not permitted. Exposed underwear of any kind <em>(including boxers, thongs, etc.) </em>is not permitted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shorts: &nbsp;</strong>Shorts are acceptable during warmer weather provided they are not tight-fitting and are no shorter than 2 inches above the top of the knee.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Women&rsquo;s Attire</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tops:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Shoulders/Backs</em></strong> &ndash; Strapless, spaghetti-strap or other tops with thin straps <em>(i.e. sundress, tank top, etc.) </em>are inappropriate for the platform and are not permitted. Bra straps should not be visible on the shoulders. Shoulders should be well-covered. Backless tops or dresses are not permitted.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Neck lines</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; Neck lines should be modest. Neck line should be high enough to ensure bust line is still fully covered when crossing arms and bending fully forward at the waist. No cleavage or portion of the breasts should be visible.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Sleeves</em></strong><strong> </strong>&ndash; Sleeveless tops are OK for warmer weather, provided they are close-fitting enough at the arms to prevent bras or underclothes from being exposed when standing, sitting, bending at the waist or extending arms and hands above the head.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Length</em></strong><strong> </strong>&ndash; Tops should be long enough that no flesh is exposed at the midriff, hips, or buttocks when standing with arms fully extended above the head, sitting or bending fully forward at the waist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pants: </strong>Pants or jeans are acceptable provided they are not tight-fitting and do not have holes.

In these cases policy application will be at the discretion of the appropriate Ministry Director. If the policy is to be applied for other events, reasonable notice shall be provided in advance to ministry participants.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Policy Communication:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Pastor of Worship &amp; Music, Senior Pastor, or other designate will seek to communicate this attire policy to all regularly-scheduled worship service platform participants. It is anticipated that good communication of the policy will prevent the need to address policy non-compliance on a personal level, and the accompanying awkwardness for all involved.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy Non-Compliance:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Pastor of Worship &amp; Music or Senior Pastor will be responsible for responding to cases of policy non-compliance. Cases of policy non-compliance will be dealt with in the following manner:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>All conversations related to policy non-compliance will be conducted in a courteous and humble manner, with a regard for the personal integrity of the individual who is approached.</li>\r\n<li>Either the Pastor of Worship &amp; Music or Senior Pastor will privately approach the non-compliant individual. If the individual in question is of the opposite sex, the ministry leader will ask another ministry leader <em>(paid or volunteer)</em> of the opposite sex to accompany him/her in approaching the individual. The ministry leader/s will address the policy non-compliance with the individual, ensure that the individual is fully informed about the attire policy, and request future compliance.</li>\r\n<li>In the event of a repeat case of policy non-compliance, a ministry leader <em>(and if necessary, a second ministry leader of the opposite sex as per #2 above)</em> will address the policy non-compliance privately with the individual and inform the individual that repeated cases of policy non-compliance may result in their being asked to withdraw from participation in platform-related ministry.</li>\r\n<li>In the event of repeated cases of policy non-compliance, the individual may be asked to withdraw from participation in platform-related ministry for a definite or indefinite period of time. The ministry leader may confer with his direct ministry supervisor prior to giving this notice.</li>\r\n<li>If the individual is asked to withdraw from ministry participation, he/she may appeal this decision to the SCCC Elders. In this event, the Elders will meet separately with the individual and the ministry leaders to review the situation. The Elders may uphold, overrule, or alter the decision as they deem most appropriate. The ruling of the Elders will be final.</li>\r\n</ol>'),

In these cases policy application will be at the discretion of the appropriate Ministry Director. If the policy is to be applied for other events, reasonable notice shall be provided in advance to ministry participants.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Policy Communication:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Pastor of Worship &amp; Music, Senior Pastor, or other designate will seek to communicate this attire policy to all regularly-scheduled worship service platform participants. It is anticipated that good communication of the policy will prevent the need to address policy non-compliance on a personal level, and the accompanying awkwardness for all involved.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy Non-Compliance:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Pastor of Worship &amp; Music or Senior Pastor will be responsible for responding to cases of policy non-compliance. Cases of policy non-compliance will be dealt with in the following manner:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>All conversations related to policy non-compliance will be conducted in a courteous and humble manner, with a regard for the personal integrity of the individual who is approached.</li>\r\n<li>Either the Pastor of Worship &amp; Music or Senior Pastor will privately approach the non-compliant individual. If the individual in question is of the opposite sex, the ministry leader will ask another ministry leader <em>(paid or volunteer)</em> of the opposite sex to accompany him/her in approaching the individual. The ministry leader/s will address the policy non-compliance with the individual, ensure that the individual is fully informed about the attire policy, and request future compliance.</li>\r\n<li>In the event of a repeat case of policy non-compliance, a ministry leader <em>(and if necessary, a second ministry leader of the opposite sex as per #2 above)</em> will address the policy non-compliance privately with the individual and inform the individual that repeated cases of policy non-compliance may result in their being asked to withdraw from participation in platform-related ministry.</li>\r\n<li>In the event of repeated cases of policy non-compliance, the individual may be asked to withdraw from participation in platform-related ministry for a definite or indefinite period of time. The ministry leader may confer with his direct ministry supervisor prior to giving this notice.</li>\r\n<li>If the individual is asked to withdraw from ministry participation, he/she may appeal this decision to the SCCC Elders. In this event, the Elders will meet separately with the individual and the ministry leaders to review the situation. The Elders may uphold, overrule, or alter the decision as they deem most appropriate. The ruling of the Elders will be final.</li>\r\n</ol>');
